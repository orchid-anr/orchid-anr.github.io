## **Hypokinetic cardiomyopathy**

Hypokinetic cardiomyopathies correspond to pathologies that decrease the motion of the heart wall. In the ORCHID project, we consider two common sources of hypokinetic cardiomyopathies, namely coronary artery disease and primary myocardial dysfunction.


### Coronary artery disease

* Coronary artery disease is the most common form of cardiovascular disease. 
* The underlying cause is ***atherosclerosis***, which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries.
* Atherosclerosis is a disease in which the immune system elicits an active inflammation within the artery wall and lipids plays a key role.
* As the inflammation and deposition of lipids progress, an ***atherosclerotic plaque*** forms in the wall of the artery. 
* Advanced atherosclerosis plaques contain inflammtory cells, smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix, lipids and acellular debris.
* As the atherosclerosis plaque increases in size, it bulges into the artery lumen and causes ***stenosis***, i.e. reduction of the artery lumen. 
* The reduction of the artery lumen causes limitations to the blood flow. This may cause symptoms in situations with increased cardiac workload (i.e. physical exercice) because the increased workload leads to increased oxygen demand but the stenosis limits the volume that can be delivered to the heart muscle supplied by the atherosclerotic artery.
* Whenever oxygen demand exceeds oxygen delivery ischemia occurs and this manifests with chest discomfort referred to as angina pectoris.

* A ***coronary angiogram*** is considered to be the best method of diagnosing coronary artery disease.
    * During the procedure a long, thin, flexible tube called catheter is inserted inta a blood vessel.
    * Using X-ray images as a guide, the tip of the catheter is passed up to the heart and coronary arteries.
    * a contrast medium is injected through the catheter and X-ray images (angiograms) are taken.
    * The contrast medium is visible on the angiograms, showing the blood vessels through which the fluid passes. This clearly highlights any blood vessels that are narrowed or blocked.

## **Left ventricular hypertrophy**

The second concerns the diagnosis of a left ventricular hypertrophy, the etiology of which can be diverse and whose assessment is particularly exhaustive and costly. In this project, we will study the two most common causes: **arterial hypertension** and **infiltrative myocardial disease**. The cohort will be composed in a balanced way of the four pathologies mentioned above with data from healthy
subjects.

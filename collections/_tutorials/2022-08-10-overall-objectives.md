## **Etiological diagnosis of cardiac diseases**

### Motivations

At present, many medical studies have been carried out to investigate the capacity of machine learning methods to detect cardiac pathologies from patient data with standard echocardiographic measurements or with the content of ultrasound images. 
> Since echocardiography is the imaging of choice for establishing a first cardiac diagnosis, this modality has naturally been the subject of important research.

However, most of the underlying studies are focused on situations where the expert cardiologist is already able to establish a diagnosis from
the data at its disposal, restricting the interest of using such methods to two main scenarios: i) the reduction of the analysis time by automatic computation of a first diagnostic hypothesis to be confirmed by an expert; ii) the deployment of automatic tools for the screening of a large population.

### Ambition and novelty

In this project, we intend to move a step forward by studying the possibility of using patient data complemented by high-quality information extracted from echocardiographic acquisitions to make etiological diagnoses. Our solution will be developed on the basis of a unique dataset that will be implemented in the particular context of this study. It will include a total of 1500 patients from a multi-center (HCL and CHU of Caen) and multi-vendor (GE and Philips systems) study for which additional examinations were carried out in order to establish an etiological
diagnosis. 

### Targeted cardiac pathologies

We will focus on two clinical situations that commonly occur and contribute to the overcrowding of hospitals and an increase in the cost of patient care. The first concerns the diagnosis of a **hypokinetic cardiomyopathy** for which the echocardiographic data do not easily allow to
distinguish a cause related to a ***coronary artery*** disease or related to a ***primary myocardial dysfunction***, imposing the realization of an invasive intervention, i.e. a coronary angiogram. 

The second concerns the diagnosis of a **left ventricular hypertrophy**, the etiology of which can be diverse and whose assessment is particularly exhaustive and costly. In this project, we will study the two most common causes: ***arterial hypertension*** and ***infiltrative myocardial disease***. The cohort will be composed in a balanced way of the four pathologies mentioned above with data from healthy
subjects. Our study can thus be seen as a 5-fold classification problem.
